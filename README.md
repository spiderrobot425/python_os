# PyOS

This is an operating system fully developed in Python that runs on your PC.

## How It Works

When you execute PyOS, it will create files in the directory where it's located.  
Specifically, it will generate a folder named **`pyos_root`**.

There’s no need to be alarmed — this operating system will only perform these actions when you run specific commands.  
For example, commands like `ls`, `cat`, and others will only execute and modify files within the `pyos_root` folder.

If you happen to delete this folder, the system will automatically recreate it, ensuring that it always maintains its operational environment.  
This design keeps your main files and other directories unaffected while allowing the system to function as intended.

## Disclaimer

If you edit this code and break it too much — including any accidental edits that cause issues with your files or programs — **it’s not my fault**.  
You use PyOS at your own risk.
